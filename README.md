> Because Bicubic Interpolation isn't good enough anymore, we are in the Machine Learning Age.
 
 ## [v1.0 is available on MediaFire due to large size](https://app.mediafire.com/nz88rdbl8u041) 
* MediaFire Folder include full "Models" folder üìÅ and executable Files üñºÔ∏è to download
* Windows64bit [[Exe]](http://www.mediafire.com/file/1zimjhmqm6bbslp/png-upscale-1.0_Windows64bit.exe/file) / [[Jar]](http://www.mediafire.com/file/8aacwpegzjlrhv0/png-upscale-1.0_Windows64bit.jar/file) / Linux64bit [[Jar]](http://www.mediafire.com/file/07e2dma5xpd2wro/png-upscale-1.0_LINUX_64bit.jar/file) / macOS [[Jar]](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ubeqpou9lhkviov/png-upscale-1.0_macOS_64bit.jar/file)
* :electron:	Download the exectable corresponding with your operating system, and the Models folder
* It's possible to download only some of the models if you want (It just wont let you use them inside the program)
* The Models folder needs to be in the same directory as the Jar/Exe to use them
* This program is best used on PNG images
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful when trying to resize very large pictures, it can take considerable time and resources ‚ö†Ô∏è
* To upscale an image you just need to choose a mode, load a picture and press start
* Save button can be used to choose an output folder *before* you start the process
* You can double click the text box to change from Dark <-> Light theme (disabled when upScaling)



## Models

> all of the download links below are already included in the mediafire folder.

There are four trained models integrated into the program :

#### EDSR

> Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow/tree/master/models).

- Size of the model: ~38.5MB x3. This is a quantized version, so that it can be uploaded to GitHub. (Original was 150MB each.)
- This model was trained for 3 days with a batch size of 16
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow
- x2, x3, x4 trained models available
- Advantage: <ins>*Highly accurate*</ins>
- Disadvantage: <ins>*Slow*</ins> and large filesize
- Speed: < 3 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Original paper: [Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) [1]

#### ESPCN

> Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN/tree/master/export).

- Size of the model: ~100kb x3
- This model was trained for ~100 iterations with a batch size of 32
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN
- x2, x3, x4 trained models available
- Advantage: It is tiny and fast, and still performs well.
- Disadvantage: Perform worse visually than newer, more robust models.
- Speed: < 0.01 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Original paper: [Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) [2]

#### FSRCNN

> Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Saafke/FSRCNN_Tensorflow/tree/master/models).

- Size of the model: ~40KB x3
- This model was trained for ~30 iterations with a batch size of 1
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/Saafke/FSRCNN_Tensorflow
- Advantage: Fast, small and accurate
- Disadvantage: Not state-of-the-art accuracy
- Speed: < 0.01 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Notes: FSRCNN-small has fewer parameters, thus less accurate but faster.
- Original paper: [Accelerating the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/FSRCNN.html) [3]

#### LapSRN

> Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-LapSRN/tree/master/export).

- Size of the model: between 1-5Mb x3
- This model was trained for ~50 iterations with a batch size of 32
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-LAPSRN
- x2, x4, x8 trained models available
- Advantage: The model can do multi-scale super-resolution with one forward pass. It can now support 2x, 4x, 8x, and [2x, 4x] and [2x, 4x, 8x] super-resolution.
- Disadvantage: It is slower than ESPCN and FSRCNN, and the accuracy is worse than EDSR.
- Speed: < 0.1 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Original paper: [Deep laplacian pyramid networks for fast and accurate super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) [4]
